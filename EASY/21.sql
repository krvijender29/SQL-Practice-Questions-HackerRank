Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

    1> Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
    2> Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
    3> Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
    4> Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
